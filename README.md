# ZenBoard

Zen Board is a simple app that lets you practice drawing, doodle, write something, whitout storing your shapes.
Your draw will disappear within a few seconds, right after tracing it. 
Is also a relaxing tool, that you can keep open on your desk while you're working, answering at the phone or whatever.
